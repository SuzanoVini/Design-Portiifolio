This is a complete project of a clhothing brand logo I made that comes with a [Visual Identity Manual](https://dglb26w8rx2ld.cloudfront.net/000_clients/3503322/file/x22349WodG2cED79.pdf). This is one of my favorite projects because it goes beyond the design it self, it also includes subjective matters, such as logo and name meaning and the image you want to transmit with it making it effective to reach the target audience.

## *KPU Shuttle Bus*
