This is a made up movie poster that I designed just for fun in Adobe Photoshop. It was also one of the most difficult designs i have ever made due to the complexity and diversity of techniques used such as color balance, smudging, lighting and shading.

## *Lepidus*
![Lepidus](https://github.com/SuzanoVini/Design-Portiifolio/blob/main/LEPIDUS.png)

This is a complete project of a clhothing brand logo I made that comes with a [Visual Identity Manual](https://dglb26w8rx2ld.cloudfront.net/000_clients/3503322/file/x22349WodG2cED79.pdf). This is my favorite project and also the one that took looger to finish, because it goes beyond the design it self, it also includes subjective matters, such as logo and name meaning and the image you want to transmit with it making it effective to reach the target audience.
